Estimate Portfolio Risk Contributions with MCMC

The final project for the University of Waterloo course STAT906, which I completed during the Fall 2019 semester. Consists in an implementation of Koike and Minami's (DOI: 10.1080/14697688.2019.1588469) MCMC method for estimating risk contributions of assets in a portfolio.
